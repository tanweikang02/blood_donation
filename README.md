# What are the Problems, Actually?

Every 2 seconds, someone urgently needs blood. Malaysia needs an average of 2,000 units of blood daily, the pandemic has slashed donation rates to a mere 2% of the population. To make it worse, there is a live-risking issue of imbalanced blood inventory. This poses a challenge for Malaysians to gain access to life-saving blood on time.

# Solutions

BloodBud, the solution the team had come up with, is capable to solve the blood transfusion-related problems in Malaysia. Some of the main features of the app include, but not limited to:

### Blood Request
Individuals who are in urgent need of Blood Transfusion can submit a request through our Blood Request feature. Here, they can specify their current location, additional details regarding the request and what are the specific blood types required. Users  will immediately receive a push notification if their blood type matches the request. This ensures a rapid and targeted response, significantly increasing the chances of timely blood donations for critical case.

### Blood Journey
For users who have donated blood and verified through our application, they can track their Blood Donation’s journey every step of the way. This transparent view not only builds trust in the donation process, but also allows donors to see the real impact of their contribution. This can lead to a greater sense of fulfillment and a deeper emotional connection to the act of donating blood.

### Education
Our solution also provides educational content that can onboard first-time donors and empower them with knowledge about the safety, procedures, and importance of blood donation.

### Statistics
In order to incentivize potential donors, we have a statistics section that shows the impact numbers and insights to show the difference they can make.

### Donation Spots
Additionally, users can view all donation events on a map and learn more about their details by clicking on them.

### Home Visit
Focusing on convenience and accessibility, BloodBud allows users to seamlessly book home-based blood donation appointments where users can donate blood from the comfort of their own homes.

### AI Chatbot
Users can chat with an AI chatbot powered by the Gemini model regarding anything related to blood donation.

### Gamification
Gamification elevates the blood donation experience with points, streaks, milestones, badges, leaderboards and custom avatars.

# Supporting Technologies

The mobile app is built using Flutter with backend services built with Cloud Function service. The data are all stored on Cloud Firestore. The chatbot is built with Google PaLM API. People can browse donation events on a map powered by Google Map API. Push notifications will be sent using Google’s Firebase Messaging service, and analytical data will be collected using the Google Analytics platform.

# Scaling Plan

With the right opportunity, the team would glad to actually launch the mobile application to contribute to the Malaysian community. The scaling plan would be as follow:

**We will build the MVP by the end of the first quarter 2024. Then, we’ll discuss the potential partnership with the relevant parties such as the Ministry of Health and the National Blood Center in the second quarter. The app will be officially launched on Google Play Store and Apple App Store in the third quarter. After that, we’ll collect users’ feedback and improve the app continuously.**
